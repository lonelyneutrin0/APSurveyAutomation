# APSurveyAutomation
# This script automates the creation of surveys. It accepts a {name} parameter and creates a survey of default questions as part of the AProject surveys. 
# Limitations:
# Due to API restrictions, it cannot control switching between sections after a section is completed, however conditional sectionalizing for options is accounted for. 
# Conditional responses, like being greater than a certain number are also not possible.
